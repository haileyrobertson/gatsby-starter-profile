I am a Data Engineer & Research Analyst in the Data Lab with Dr. Ellie Graeden at the Georgetown University Center for Global Health Science and Security. I graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Global Health and a minor in Human Security and Geospatial Intelligence.

My research interests include emerging infectious diseases, global health policy, and predictive analytics. I apply machine learning, network science, and other computational approaches to address challenges related to spillover risk and outbreak detection, decision-making for emergency response, and data-sharing in disease ecology.
